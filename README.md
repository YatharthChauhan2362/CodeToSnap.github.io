Made By CodeToSnap (Yatharth Chauhan)

This repository contains the code for the CodeToSnap website, which is a platform for sharing and discovering code snippets.

## Problem

The problem this project aims to solve is to provide a platform for developers to share and discover code snippets. Often, developers need to find a solution to a specific problem, and they can benefit from seeing how other developers have solved similar problems. CodeToSnap aims to make it easy for developers to share and discover code snippets.

## Solution

We have developed a web application that allows developers to share and discover code snippets. The application has a simple and intuitive user interface that makes it easy to search for and browse code snippets. Users can also upload their own code snippets and tag them with relevant keywords to make them easier to find.
